What project are you building
Short summary/abstract of your project: 

We are METARACERX! We are a Racing NFT game that will enter the Metaverse in mobile game play and VR. We are a virtual play-toearn game that will be in future iterations will be played in the Metaverse.

Players can collect virtual cars, drivers, and car parts in this exciting new blockchain game. Each piece is a unique non-fungible token 
and can be collected, traded, used, or sold individually. METARACERX already has some legendary vehicles, but a majority of the 
collection will feature a wide variety of different car types. Players will have the ability to upgrade their cars using prodigy tokens 
earned within the game.
Competitive racing will be a core element of METARACERX. Each car has its own unique characteristics. The factors influencing the 
car's performance are acceleration, grip, top speed, and luck. The first iteration of the game will highlight races that are shown topdown and have a limited number of options in its first release.




Why did you decide to build it
Short summary of your motivation:

We are excited to bring you a one-of-a-kind experience! The Change of Facebook name to "Meta" is a big move and just the beginning of what is to come, gaming and the way the technology will work in the next few years will change dramatically.

We want to transform gaming into your life and be able for you to play competitively at every level as a job, profession, or just for fun & games but to be able to earn. The way we want to bring a virtual experience to be like magic, at home, in the classroom for learning, work jobs, and business.

How long will it take
Estimation of how long you will need to finalize the project: 



How much funding are you requesting: 

Our goal is $3,000,000 which will cover our ongoing development costs and enable us to set up Prodigy Token, according to the Tokenomics that we have outlined in the MetaRacerX Whitepaper.

Project description:

On MetaRacerX, you are behind the wheel of a state-of-the-art vehicle, pitted against other players, whose vehicles are just as fast (or almost as fast!) as your own. Every time you line up at the starting line, you get a chance to win virtual cars, virtual drivers, and virtual car parts, all minted as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) so that they hold some value. Each piece of unique, meaning that you can use them if you like, to show off, or you can trade them and sell them, if you think you can find a lucrative deal out there.
This is a community game. Featuring legendary vehicles as well as our own designs, MetRacerX is a new sort of blockchain game, one that tempts you with the opportunity to earn rewards – but keeps exciting, competitive racing at the center of it all. Every car is different, better or worse in terms of acceleration, grip, and top speed. It's up to you to find and obtain the best car possible.
We firmly believe that MetaracerX suits the core mission of Gnosis  ecosystem which is to redistribute the future. 
We want to transform gaming into your life and be able for you to play competitively at every level as a job, profession, or just for fun & games but to be able to earn. The way we want to bring a virtual experience to be like magic, at home, in the classroom for learning, work jobs, and business, this is just the start of what we have in goal.

Features:

For those who are still unfamiliar with the metaverse, think of it as a 3D, alternate universe, in which you can claim your virtual space, connect with others who are doing the same, play games, do work, create, chat, collaborate, and more.
In MetaRacerX, you can manage and own your own piece of the metaverse, which will exist on the blockchain. You will be in excellent company too, as we are already in discussions to get celebrities, influencers, and NFT luminaries into the game.
Long-term, we see MetaRacerX as one foray among many. We would like to make our mark on the metaverse by working with other projects and creators, offering sponsorship opportunities in order to encourage the more involved and higher-profile players to commit themselves to the game over time.
Everyone gets an avatar, though. When you play, that avatar becomes your identity. As we release additional metaverse games, such as boxing, soccer, and basketball, your avatar will carry over. You are, in a real way, making a name for yourself as an athlete and competitor.
Do you have it in you to get to the top in this new world?
Fun – with a Purpose
Of equal importance to gameplay in MetRacerX is Prodigy Token, a utility token that we are minting for the in-game ecosystem. This is a cryptocurrency that you earn while you play. If you win a race, if you finish a race, if you finish a lap, and if you complete any one of the other challenges that we have set, you can get real tokens.
You can then risk those tokens to earn even more.
